#### Tets  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, the user mentioned they aren't sharing any files yet. So, I can't make any changes to existing files. My first thought is to ask them to provide the necessary files so I can help. But maybe they have a specific request in mind. Let me check their message again.

They wrote "Tets" which might be a typo for "Tests". They probably want to add tests to their project. Since they haven't provided any files, I need to prompt them to share the relevant files first. For example, if they have a module they want to test, I need those files to create corresponding test cases.

I should explain that I can help set up tests once I know which files to work with. Maybe suggest common testing frameworks like pytest or unittest, depending on their project. Also, ask if they have existing tests or if they need to start from scratch. It's important to get clarity on their setup to provide accurate assistance.

I'll structure my response to request the necessary files and ask about their testing preferences. That way, once they provide the details, I can generate the appropriate SEARCH/REPLACE blocks or create new test files as needed.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

I notice you might have meant "Tests" - would you like help setting up tests for your project? Since you're not sharing files yet, I'll need you to:

1. Share the files you want to test
2. Tell me which testing framework you prefer (pytest, unittest, etc.)
3. Let me know if you want to create new tests or modify existing ones

Please share the relevant files first so I can propose specific changes using the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format.

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user mentioned they have added files to the chat, but when I look, I see that the "ask" file is empty. There's no content provided. So, I can't proceed with any changes because there's nothing to edit. 

First, I need to check if there was a mistake. Maybe the user intended to share some files but forgot to include their contents. Without any code or files to work with, I can't create SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. The rules clearly state that I should only edit files that have been added to the chat, and the user hasn't provided any.

I should ask the user to clarify or provide the necessary files. It's important to follow the guidelines: if the files aren't present, I can't make changes. So, the best step is

Okay, I understand the formatting requirements.  I'm ready for your code changes request.

#### How do I give you a file right now  

You can provide the file content directly in the chat, using the *file listing* format I described.  For example, if you have a file named `my_script.py` with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

You would provide it to me like this:

my_script.py
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I will then be able to process and suggest changes based on your requests.
